* Introduction
This is a simple library I made because I needed to show multiple progress bars, I know it might be easy to use something already there but I just modified one in C I found that was simple enough.

I've made it in a way it can also be used from python. In future my plan is to make it support multiprocessing progress. That's why I made one global progress state, let's see.

NOTE: As for supporting multiprocessing, I wrote another program [[https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/dmon][dmon]] which is for monitoring parallel processing, it uses this program for printing bars, while it uses dbus for communication of progress information between processes. Do look it up.

** Features
- Multiple bars with their own progress metric
- Multiple status lines you can update (passing strings)
- Completed bars will be moved to the top if you only print active ones.
- Completed bars will show the time of completion


** Planned Features
- Dynamically increase number of bars/status lines

This is a dead simple progress bar implementation for C. 
It has no extra dependencies (like libtermcap / ncurses) 
and should be easily dropped into any project. As an added
bonus, it'll report time ETAs for long running jobs.


The main interface is `print_progress`, which takes in a percentage
and a timestamp. Call it repeatedly in a loop to make the progress
bar grow across the screen.
