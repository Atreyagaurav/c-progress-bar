* Introduction
This is a simple library I made because I needed to show multiple progress bars, I know it might be easy to use something already there but I just modified one in C I found that was simple enough.

I've made it in a way it can also be used from python. In future my plan is to make it support multiprocessing progress. That's why I made one global progress state, let's see.

This is a dead simple progress bar implementation for C. 
It has no extra dependencies (like libtermcap / ncurses) 
and should be easily dropped into any project. As an added
bonus, it'll report time ETAs for long running jobs.


The main interface is `print_progress`, which takes in a percentage
and a timestamp. Call it repeatedly in a loop to make the progress
bar grow across the screen.
